**Cryptochain - A crypto-currency network**

_This is just a sample project made for the purpose of learning the underlying principles of Blockchain technology._

The Cryptochain project is a simple simulator of crypto-currency and blockchain. This project encompasses features like creating a wallet, conducting transactions across wallets, mining blocks and subsequent reward generation, and broadcasting the mined blocks to all the peers in the network. The technologies used to build this project are : Node.js for Back-end and React JS for Front-end.

In order to get this in action, install node.js in your system.  Then, clone this repo into the desired directory and install the dependencies mentioned in the package.json file using &emsp;&emsp;npm install  Start the Master Development Node using &emsp;&emsp;npm run dev  Start the peer nodes using &emsp;&emsp;npm run dev-peer

To access the User Interface, open the web browser and enter http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]  [PORT_NUMBER] = 3000 (to access the Master Development Node)  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; = the port number mentioned in the command prompt where the peer-node is started (to access a peer node).
